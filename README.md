# OBS-AVOID-BOT
This project features a smart obstacle avoidance robot integrated with IoT-based remote control and real-time monitoring. Built using an Arduino Uno R4 Wi-Fi, ultrasonic sensors, DC motors, and the Blynk IoT platform, the robot can navigate autonomously while also being controlled via a mobile app.
