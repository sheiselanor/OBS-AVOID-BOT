# OBS-AVOID-BOT
This project features a smart obstacle avoidance robot integrated with IoT-based remote control and real-time monitoring. Built using an Arduino Uno R4 Wi-Fi, ultrasonic sensors, DC motors, and the Blynk IoT platform, the robot can navigate autonomously while also being controlled via a mobile app.

Key Features:
1. Obstacle Detection & Avoidance: Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and adjust movement accordingly.
2. IoT Remote Control: Blynk app interface enables manual movement control (forward, backward, left, right).
3. Real-time Monitoring: Live sensor data (distance measurements) displayed on the Blynk platform.
4. Dual Mode Operation: Supports both manual mode (user-controlled) and autonomous mode (self-navigating).

Applications:
1. Educational tool for STEM learning (IoT, robotics, automation).
2. Smart navigation systems for automation and exploration.
3. Assistive robotics for obstacle detection and movement planning.
